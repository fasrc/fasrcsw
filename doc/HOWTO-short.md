__cd__ to your personal *HeLmod* clone (on the canonical build host, as you, not root), and get setup:

``` bash
git pull
module purge
source ./setup-rocky8.sh
```

__download__ the source archive to `"$FASRCSW_DEV"/rpmbuild/SOURCES`

__define__ what you're working on (`TYPE` is `Core` for generic things, `Comp` if you really want to build using newer compilers, or `MPI` for MPI-enabled things):

``` bash
export NAME=...
export VERSION=...
export RELEASE=...
export TYPE=...
```

__create__ a spec file:

``` bash
cd "$FASRCSW_DEV"/rpmbuild/SPECS
cp -ai template.spec "$NAME-$VERSION-$RELEASE".spec
```

__edit__ the spec file and __address__ each `FIXME` up until the modulefile.lua creation (i.e. adjust the `./configure`/`make`/`make install` snippets if necessary)

do a __trial build__:

``` bash
make trial
```

__finish__ the spec file (modulefile.lua creation), based upon the suggestions in the output from the above.

__build__ it for real:

``` bash
make
```

__install__ it:

``` bash
make test
make install
```

__commit/post__ your updates (this adds/commits/pushes/rsyncs *all* local content):

``` bash
make post
```

__publish__ new module to [docs page](https://docs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/kb/all-modules/)
